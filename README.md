# Workday-Scheduler
## Description
A time management application powered by JQuery that allows the user to list when various tasks are scheduled throughout the day as well as dynamically showing what and when things are scheduled throughout the day. It will also update with color-coding styles to display which time blocks have passed that day, which ones are still upcoming, and which one you're currently in.
